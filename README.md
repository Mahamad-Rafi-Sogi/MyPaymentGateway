MyPaymentGateway

MyPaymentGateway is a simple and lightweight payment gateway integration project that leverages a test payment key and secret for simulating real-world payment transactions. It uses a webhook to process and manage transaction updates, making it ideal for developers looking to test and integrate payment functionalities in their applications.

Key Features:
	•	Test Payment Setup: Utilizes test payment credentials (key and secret) to simulate transactions without real financial exchanges, ideal for development and testing environments.
	•	Webhook Integration: The project listens to webhook notifications to handle events such as successful payments, failures, or cancellations, ensuring real-time updates and efficient transaction management.
	•	Simple Integration: Provides easy-to-use API endpoints for integrating payment processing into any application, with minimal configuration.
	•	Security: While using test credentials, the application implements secure protocols for ensuring that sensitive information is handled correctly during the development phase.

Technologies Used:
	•	Java and Spring Boot: Powers the backend of the gateway, making it scalable and suitable for production-grade applications.
	•	Webhook for Event Handling: Listens to payment event notifications for real-time updates on transaction statuses.
	•	Testing APIs: Integrates with simulated payment services using test keys for safe development and debugging.
